# apache-kafka
Kafka implementation with Golang

Kafka is na open-source event streaming platform used for publishing and processing events at
high throughput.

The idea of this project is put in practice what I've learned about Apache Kafka by creating a simple
broker that produce and consume infinite messages. Only one Broker is running on the application.
